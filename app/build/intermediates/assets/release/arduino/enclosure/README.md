# EmergencyWatch 3D Printed Enclosure

This directory contains 3D printable files for creating a wearable enclosure for the Emerband Arduino-based emergency smartwatch.

## Files Included

- `EmergencyWatch_Case.stl` - The main enclosure case
- `EmergencyWatch_Buttons.stl` - Button caps for the four emergency buttons
- `EmergencyWatch_Back.stl` - Back cover with battery compartment
- `EmergencyWatch_Strap_Attachment.stl` - Attachments for watch straps

## Printing Instructions

### Recommended Settings

- **Material**: PLA or PETG
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Supports**: Required for the main case
- **Build Plate Adhesion**: Brim recommended
- **Nozzle Size**: 0.4mm standard

### Specific Part Instructions

#### Main Case
- Print with the open face up
- Use supports for the button holes and display opening
- Ensure good quality for the threaded areas where the back attaches

#### Buttons
- Print all four buttons at once, flat side down
- No supports needed
- Consider using a contrasting color for emergency visibility

#### Back Cover
- Print flat side down
- No supports needed if your printer handles bridging well
- Ensure close tolerances for a good seal

#### Strap Attachments
- Print standing upright
- Use supports for the attachment holes

## Assembly Instructions

1. Insert the Arduino Nano 33 BLE into the main case, aligning with the mounting posts
2. Connect the buttons, display, and any other components according to the wiring diagram
3. Install the battery in the back cover compartment
4. Secure all wires neatly inside the case
5. Align and snap the back cover onto the main case
6. Secure with the four small screws (M2 x 6mm recommended)
7. Attach the strap attachments and install your preferred 20mm watch strap

## Design Considerations

The enclosure is designed to be:

- Water-resistant (but not waterproof)
- Comfortable to wear
- Accessible for emergency buttons
- Protective of internal components
- Compatible with standard 20mm watch straps

## Customization

The original design files are available in Fusion 360 format upon request. You can modify the design to:

- Accommodate different button layouts
- Change the size for larger batteries
- Add additional sensor openings
- Customize the appearance or ergonomics

## Notes

- The buttons are designed to provide tactile feedback while preventing accidental presses
- The case has ventilation to prevent overheating
- The display opening is sized for the standard 128x32 OLED display
- Battery access is from the back to maintain the integrity of the front face
